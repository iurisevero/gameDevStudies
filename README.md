# Game Dev Studies

Repo to save my game dev studies and, maybe, become a portfolio.
The idea is to develop several game prototypes of various kinds and using different engines.
The focus is on the code, I want to write it well, with modularization and stuff, however the art will not be pretty, neither the music's (I'll try my best on UI/UX ðŸ˜¬).

1Âº Game: Pacman (like)
